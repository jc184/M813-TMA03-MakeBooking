# M813-TMA03-MakeBooking
This is a project that forms part of Module M813 Software Development, TMA03 for The Open University, 2017. Alba Airways is a fictitious Scottish airline that operates new routes between Scottish cities and the Highlands and Islands. To operate in a competitive marketplace the company requires a modern computerized booking, registration and payment system, which will be available online, to attract business and encourage customers to keep using the service. The system will allow customers to register, login, search and book flights, choose seats, make payments, and check in on a PC, Tablet or Smartphone. This application is the result of combining M813-TMA02-CustomerLogin, M813-TMA02-RegisterCustomer, M813-TMA02-ChooseFlight and M813-TMA02-ChooseSeat which were built using Design by Contract and UML, and it has been written in Java in Netbeans 8.2. I would appreciate any feedback on this application, either by using Issues or by emailing me james.chalmers184@gmail.com
